# Neural Network Classification in Python

Neural networks are a powerful class of machine learning models that have gained popularity due to their ability to effectively learn complex patterns in data. In this article, we'll explore how to implement a neural network classification model in Python using the TensorFlow library. We'll walk through the process of building, training, and evaluating a neural network for classification tasks, using a classic example dataset.

## Introduction to Neural Network Classification

Classification is a fundamental task in machine learning where the goal is to categorize input data points into predefined classes or categories. Neural network classification involves using a neural network model to learn a mapping from input features to output class labels. This process typically involves training the model on a labeled dataset, where each data point is associated with a specific class label.

## Dataset: Iris Flowers

For our classification example, we'll use the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning. The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica. Each sample contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Implementation with TensorFlow

We'll implement the neural network classification model in Python using the TensorFlow library. TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google that provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools and libraries for building and deploying machine learning models.
