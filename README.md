# Neural Network Regression in Python

This repository contains Python code for implementing neural network regression using TensorFlow and Keras. Neural networks are powerful computational models inspired by the human brain, capable of capturing complex relationships in data. This implementation focuses on using neural networks for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict continuous numerical values based on input features.

## Overview

In this project, we demonstrate how to build and train a neural network regression model using Python. The implementation utilizes TensorFlow and Keras, popular libraries for deep learning in Python. We provide a simple example to illustrate the process of creating and training a neural network for regression tasks.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install tensorflow keras numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-network-regression.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd neural-network-regression
```

3. Run the Python script:

```
python neural_network_regression.py
```

This script trains a neural network regression model on synthetic data and evaluates its performance using mean squared error.

## Example

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 2 * X.squeeze() + 1 + 0.1 * np.random.randn(100)

# Define the neural network architecture
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=50, batch_size=10)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)

# Evaluate the model
loss = model.evaluate(X, y)
print("Mean Squared Error:", loss)
```

## Conclusion

Neural networks offer a flexible and powerful approach to regression problems, allowing the modeling of complex relationships in data. By leveraging Python's capabilities and libraries like TensorFlow and Keras, data scientists can unlock the full potential of neural networks in regression tasks.
